# MasterThesis : "Kidney segmentation in MRI images using deep learning: A comparison between U-NET and Attention U-NET"

This folder contains:
- My master thesis file: "Kidney segmentation in MRI images using deep learning: A comparison between U-NET and Attention U-NET";
- Extended Summary of Master thesis in IEEE article format;
- Contains machine learning models for kidney segmentation from 2 classes (kidney and background);
- Contains machine learning models for kidney segmentation from 3 classes (kidney, contour and background);

Models include:
- Pre-processing;
- Data augmentation;
- Neural Network;
- Prediction;
- Evaluation (confusion matrix, recall, precision, dice, iou);
- Evaluation graphs;
- 10-k cross-validation.

Loss functions implemented:
- Cross-Entropy loss function;
- Focal loss function.

TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEORICAL AND PRACTICAL APPROACHES, I RECOMMEND READING THE EXTENDED SUMMARY.
