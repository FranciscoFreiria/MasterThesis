# MasterThesis : "Kidney segmentation in MRI images using deep learning: A comparison between U-NET and Attention U-NET"

This folder contains:
	- Extended Summary of Master thesis in IEEE article format;
	- My master thesis file: "Kidney segmentation in MRI images using deep learning: A
comparison between U-NET and Attention U-NET";
	- Contains machine learning models for kidney segmentation from 2 classes (kidney and background);
	- Contains machine learning models for kidney segmentation from 3 classes (kidney, contour and background);

Models include:
	- Pre-processing;
	- Data augmentation;
	- Neural Network;
	- Prediction;
	- Evaluation (confusion matrix, recall, precision, dice, iou);
	- Evaluation graphs;
	- 10-k cross-validation.
